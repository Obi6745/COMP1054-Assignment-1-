            <div class="verse">
                <p>Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out</p>
                <p>Get some air now, let your edge out</p>
                <p>Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind</p>
                <p>Can you get the heck out?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="verse">
                <p>I need rest now, got me bummed out</p>
                <p>You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe</p>
                <p>I've been on my empty mind shit</p>
                <p>I try to keep from losin' the rest of me</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby</p>
                <p>You don't care</p>
                <p>Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent</p>
                <p>Tryna make sense of loose change</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verse">
                <p>Got me at war in my mind</p>
                <p>Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me</p>
                <p>Choose to watch</p>
                <p>While the world break up and fall on me</p>
